### General property: _prop_

During form submission, all for form fields are grouped together inside a single object (in form of key value pairs with field name and value) and passed to the onSubmit callback function.

#### 1. For example: Consider the following field

```json
{
    "name": "first_name",
    "meta": {
        "displayName": "First name",
        "displayType": "text_field",
        "value": "Goku"
    }
}
```

Output of the following field during form submission:

```
{
    "first_name": "Goku"
}
```

#### 2. Example with _prop_

Now, use the _prop_ field property if the field needs to be grouped in a different field name.

```json
{
    "name": "first_name",
    "prop": "basic_details",
    "meta": {
        "displayName": "First name",
        "displayType": "text_field",
        "value": "Goku"
    }
}
```

Output would be:

```
{
    "basic_details": {
        "first_name": "Goku"
    }
}
```

#### 3. Example with nested _prop_

If a field is required to be grouped in a nested group, then use **#** as a seperator

```json
{
    "name": "first_name",
    "prop": "basic_details#personal_details",
    "meta": {
        "displayName": "First name",
        "displayType": "text_field",
        "value": "Goku"
    }
}
```

Output

```
{
    "basic_details": {
        "personal_details: {
            "first_name": "Goku"
        }
    }
}
```
