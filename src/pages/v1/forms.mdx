## Type of forms:

-   Simple forms
-   Grouped forms

## Simple forms

    Simple form is a single form which contains all the fields together in a single view.

## Grouped forms

    Grouped forms consist of individual forms organized into distinct sections, with each section containing a single form,
    complete with its own set of fields.

Following types of grouped forms are supported:

-   Tab
-   Stepper
-   Wizard

### Tab

    Forms are divided into various tab groups, granting users access to different forms through either tabs or by utilizing the next/previous button.

### Stepper

    Forms are divided into distinct steps, hence the term "stepper." Access to different sections of the form is exclusively possible in a sequential manner, following the predefined order in the schema, using the next/previous button. Each step is denoted by a header displaying the current form's step count.

### Wizard

    Forms are divided into various sections accessible exclusively through the use of the next/previous buttons. While the order of the form groups is upheld, unlike the stepper-style grouped forms, they do not include headers.
